## Branching Strategy and Agile Pattern

We will follow the **Agile** pattern and best practices, in particular we adopt stand-up meetings and a public [Trello blackboad](https://trello.com/b/GHashjJM/cubes-2019) to track tasks and issues. 

> For some authorization issues we have decided to fork the repo in order to be able to bound the branches to the Trello tasks.

The applied branching strategy is **feature-oriented** so we have a branch for every single task and the main/static branches are `master` and `dev` following the standards that we can find in any enterprise working environment. Finally any merge will be made by a **pull request**.
